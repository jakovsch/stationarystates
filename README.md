# stationarystates

Rendering single-electron atomic orbitals in the browser with WebGL.
The energy state of such an atom is described by the quantum numbers `n`, `l` and `m`.
Its corresponding wavefunction is then repeatedly sampled, giving a cloud of probable positions of the single electron.
If each position is considered independently, then its motion as a particle can be simulated with a velocity field given by the guiding equation (de Broglie-Bohm theory), also known as the 'probability current'. ([TODO](TODO.md))
