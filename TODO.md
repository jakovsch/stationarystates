## Performance

- [x] instance attribs: use vec3 instead of mat4
- [x] scale factor (radius) as uniform
- [] minimal camera far field
- [] normal buffer: use packed ints instead of floats
  - [] interleave vertex/normals
- [x] minimize inversions/transpositions in shaders
- [] dynamic_draw vs stream_draw
- [] canvas image-rendering: pixelated

## Features

- [x] dynamic sample count (switch to heap array)
- [x] distribution that samples around origin more often
- [] SSAO and deferred rendering
- [] Simulate electron trajectories (guiding eq./probability current)
- [] Website UI and controls
